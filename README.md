# COVID-19 Infected Cases, Deaths Data Exploration in SQL and Visualization in Tableau

This repository contains SQL scripts to explore COVID-19 data on infected cases, deaths, and vaccinations from various countries. The scripts were used to query the data, clean it, and aggregate it to produce a final datasets that is then used for visualization in Tableau.

The final Tableau visualization allows users to compare the COVID-19 situation in different countries and regions, and track the progress of vaccinations in different parts of the world.
